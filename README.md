# StyleGAN3 with a few tweaks

This is a fork of the original [StyleGAN3](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan3) codebase.

The goal of this repository is to continue developping the tooling for training and inferring StyleGAN3 for my own usage on macOS, Windows and Linux.

## Setup

This was tested on Python 3.13 only.
Recommended to use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for easy setup.
